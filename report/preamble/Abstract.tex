\chapter*{Abstract}

The ocean is one of the ancient mysteries of mankind even before the written history. Humanity made the world ours over the water, 
from the Portuguese greatest discoveries, braving the raging ocean to the newest oil tanker demanding ever newer technology
in order to tame the sea for safer and smoother sailing.

Nowadays, scientists believe only 20\% to 26\% of the ocean is discovered with the actual technology, which means that humanity 
knows as much about our great sky as our own seas. The 5S ocean drifter is equipment made to acquire data from 
superficial sea streams and expand the oceanographic knowledge about them.

Improved ocean knowledge supports development in various areas, enhancing safety, security, plannign 
of shorter trips over seas, less fuel consuption and most recently energy harvesting.
